	abstract = {Natural selection drives evolving populations up the fitness landscape, the projection from nucleotide sequence space to organismal reproductive success. While it has long been appreciated that topographic complexities on fitness landscapes can arise only as a consequence of epistatic interactions between mutations, evolutionary genetics has mainly focused on epistasis between pairs of mutations. Here we propose a generalization to the classical population genetic treatment of pairwise epistasis that yields expressions for epistasis among arbitrary subsets of mutations of all orders (pairwise, three-way, etc.). Our approach reveals substantial higher-order epistasis in almost every published fitness landscape. Furthermore we demonstrate that higher-order epistasis is critically important in two systems we know best. We conclude that higher-order epistasis deserves empirical and theoretical attention from evolutionary geneticists.},

	abstract = {Genotypic ﬁtness landscapes are constructed by assessing the ﬁtness of all possible combinations of a given number of mutations. In the last years, several experimental ﬁtness landscapes have been completely resolved. As ﬁtness landscapes are high-dimensional, simple measures of their structure are used as statistics in empirical applications. Epistasis is one of the most relevant features of ﬁtness landscapes. Here we propose a new natural measure of the amount of epistasis based on the correlation of ﬁtness effects of mutations. This measure has a natural interpretation, captures well the interaction between mutations and can be obtained analytically for most landscape models. We discuss how this measure is related to previous measures of epistasis (number of peaks, roughness/slope, fraction of sign epistasis, Fourier–Walsh spectrum) and how it can be easily extended to landscapes with missing data or with ﬁtness ranks only. Furthermore, the dependence of the correlation of ﬁtness effects on mutational distance contains interesting information about the patterns of epistasis. This dependence can be used to uncover the amount and nature of epistatic interactions in a landscape or to discriminate between different landscape models.},

	abstract = {Populations exposed to a high mutation rate harbor abundant deleterious genetic variation, leading to depressed mean fitness. This reduction in mean fitness presents an opportunity for selection to restore fitness through the evolution of mutational robustness. In extreme cases, selection for mutational robustness can lead to flat genotypes (with low fitness but high robustness) outcompeting fit genotypes (with high fitness but low robustness)—a phenomenon known as survival of the flattest. While this effect was previously explored using the digital evolution system Avida, a complete analysis of the local fitness landscapes of fit and flat genotypes has been lacking, leading to uncertainty about the genetic basis of the survival-of-the-flattest effect. Here, we repeated the survival-of-the-flattest study and analyzed the mutational neighborhoods of fit and flat genotypes. We found that the flat genotypes, compared to the fit genotypes, had a reduced likelihood of deleterious mutations as well as an increased likelihood of neutral and, surprisingly, of lethal mutations. This trend holds for mutants one to four substitutions away from the wild-type sequence. We also found that flat genotypes have, on average, no epistasis between mutations, while fit genotypes have, on average, positive epistasis. Our results demonstrate that the genetic causes of mutational robustness on complex fitness landscapes are multifaceted. While the traditional idea of the survival of the flattest emphasized the evolution of increased neutrality, others have argued for increased mutational sensitivity in response to strong mutational loads. Our results show that both increased neutrality and increased lethality can lead to the evolution of mutational robustness. Furthermore, strong negative epistasis is not required for mutational sensitivity to lead to mutational robustness. Overall, these results suggest that mutational robustness is achieved by minimizing heritable deleterious variation.},

	abstract = {Parallel and convergent evolution have been remarkably common observations in molecular adaptation but primarily in the context of the same genotype adapting to the same conditions. These phenomena therefore tell us about the stochasticity and limitations of adaptation. The limited data on convergence and parallelism in the adaptation of different genotypes conflict as to the importance of such events. If the effects of beneficial mutations are highly context dependent (i.e., if they are epistatic), different genotypes should adapt through different mutations. Epistasis for beneficial mutations has been investigated but mainly through measurement of interactions between individually beneficial mutations for the same genotype. We examine epistasis for beneficial mutations at a broader genetic scale by measuring the fitness effects of two mutations beneficial for the ssDNA bacteriophage ID11 in eight different, related genotypes showing 0.3–3.7\% nucleotide divergence from ID11. We found no evidence for sign epistasis, but the mutations tended to have much smaller or no effects on fitness in the new genotypes. We found evidence for diminishing-returns epistasis; the effects were more beneficial for lower-fitness genotypes. The patterns of epistasis were not determined by phylogenetic relationships to the original genotype. To improve our understanding of the patterns of epistasis, we fit the data to a model in which each mutation had a constant, nonepistatic phenotypic effect across genotypes and the phenotype-fitness map had a single optimum. This model fit the data well, suggesting that epistasis for these mutations was due to nonlinearity in the phenotype-fitness mapping and that the likelihood of parallel evolution depends more on phenotype than on genotype.},

	abstract = {The fitness effect of mutations can be influenced by their interactions with the environment, other mutations, or both. Previously, we constructed 32 ( = 25) genotypes that comprise all possible combinations of the first five beneficial mutations to fix in a laboratory-evolved population of Escherichia coli. We found that (i) all five mutations were beneficial for the background on which they occurred; (ii) interactions between mutations drove a diminishing returns type epistasis, whereby epistasis became increasingly antagonistic as the expected fitness of a genotype increased; and (iii) the adaptive landscape revealed by the mutation combinations was smooth, having a single global fitness peak. Here we examine how the environment influences epistasis by determining the interactions between the same mutations in two alternative environments, selected from among 1,920 screened environments, that produced the largest increase or decrease in fitness of the most derived genotype. Some general features of the interactions were consistent: mutations tended to remain beneficial and the overall pattern of epistasis was of diminishing returns. Other features depended on the environment; in particular, several mutations were deleterious when added to specific genotypes, indicating the presence of antagonistic interactions that were absent in the original selection environment. Antagonism was not caused by consistent pleiotropic effects of individual mutations but rather by changing interactions between mutations. Our results demonstrate that understanding adaptation in changing environments will require consideration of the combined effect of epistasis and pleiotropy across environments.},

Novel experimental approaches combined with next-generation sequencing (NGS) methods enable accurate and extensive studies of the fitness effects of mutations, allowing us to test theoretical predictions and improve our understanding of the shape of the true underlying fitness landscape and its implications for the predictability and repeatability of evolution. Here, we present a uniquely large multiallelic fitness landscape comprising 640 engineered mutants that represent all possible combinations of 13 amino acid-changing mutations at 6 sites in the heat-shock protein Hsp90 in
              Saccharomyces cerevisiae
              under elevated salinity. Despite a prevalent pattern of negative epistasis in the landscape, we find that the global fitness peak is reached via four positively epistatic mutations. Combining traditional and extending recently proposed theoretical and statistical approaches, we quantify features of the global multiallelic fitness landscape. Using subsets of the data, we demonstrate that extrapolation beyond a known part of the landscape is difficult owing to both local ruggedness and amino acid-specific epistatic hotspots and that inference is additionally confounded by the nonrandom choice of mutations for experimental fitness landscapes.},

	abstract = {Linkage effects in a multi-locus population strongly influence its evolution. The models based on the traveling wave approach enable us to predict the average speed of evolution and the statistics of phylogeny. However, predicting statistically the evolution of specific sites and pairs of sites in the multi-locus context remains a mathematical challenge. In particular, the effects of epistasis, the interaction of gene regions contributing to phenotype, is difficult to predict theoretically and detect experimentally in sequence data. A large number of false-positive interactions arises from stochastic linkage effects and indirect interactions, which mask true epistatic interactions. Here we develop a proof-of-principle method to filter out false-positive interactions. We start by demonstrating that the averaging of haplotype frequencies over multiple independent populations is necessary but not sufficient for epistatic detection, because it still leaves high numbers of false-positive interactions. To compensate for the residual stochastic noise, we develop a three-way haplotype method isolating true interactions. The fidelity of the method is confirmed analytically and on simulated genetic sequences evolved with a known epistatic network. The method is then applied to a large sequence database of neurominidase protein of influenza A H1N1 obtained from various geographic locations to infer the epistatic network responsible for the difference between the pre-pandemic virus and the pandemic strain of 2009. These results present a simple and reliable technique to measure epistatic interactions of any sign from sequence data.},

While this process is simple for fitness landscapes where mutations are independent, the interaction between mutations (epistasis) as well as mutations at loci that affect more than one trait (pleiotropy) are crucial in complex and realistic fitness landscapes. We investigate the impact of epistasis and pleiotropy on adaptive evolution by studying the evolution of a population of asexual haploid organisms (haplotypes) in a model of N interacting loci, where each locus interacts with K other loci. We use a quantitative measure of the magnitude of epistatic interactions between substitutions, and find that it is an increasing function of K. When haplotypes adapt at high mutation rates, more epistatic pairs of substitutions are observed on the line of descent than expected. The highest fitness is attained in landscapes with an intermediate amount of ruggedness that balance the higher fitness potential of interacting genes with their concomitant decreased evolvability. Our findings imply that the synergism between loci that interact epistatically is crucial for evolving genetic modules with high fitness, while too much ruggedness stalls the adaptive process.},

Resistance mutations are known to impair fitness, and the evolution of resistance to multiple drugs depends both on their costs individually and on how they interact—epistasis. Information on the level of epistasis between antibiotic resistance mutations is of key importance to understanding epistasis amongst deleterious alleles, a key theoretical question, and to improving public health measures. Here we show that in an antibiotic-free environment the cost of multiple resistance is smaller than expected, a signature of pervasive positive epistasis among alleles that confer resistance to antibiotics. Competition assays reveal that the cost of resistance to a given antibiotic is dependent on the presence of resistance alleles for other antibiotics. Surprisingly we find that a significant fraction of resistant mutations can be beneficial in certain resistant genetic backgrounds, that some double resistances entail no measurable cost, and that some allelic combinations are hotspots for rapid compensation. These results provide additional insight as to why multi-resistant bacteria are so prevalent and reveal an extra layer of complexity on epistatic patterns previously unrecognized, since it is hidden in genome-wide studies of genetic interactions using gene knockouts.},

Wright distinguished between landscapes possessing multiple ﬁtness peaks and those with only a single peak and emphasized that the former class imposes substantially greater constraint on natural selection. Here I present novel formalism that more ﬁnely partitions the universe of possible ﬁtness landscapes on the basis of the rank ordering of their genotypic ﬁtness values. In this report I focus on ﬁtness landscapes lacking sign epistasis (i.e., landscapes that lack mutations the sign of whose ﬁtness effect varies epistatically), which constitute a subset of Wright’s single peaked landscapes. More than one ﬁtness rank ordering lacking sign epistasis exists for L . 2 (where L is the number of interacting loci), and I ﬁnd that a highly statistically signiﬁcant effect exists between landscape membership in ﬁtness rank-ordering partition and two different proxies for genetic constraint, even within this subset of landscapes. This statistical association is robust to population size, permitting general inferences about some of the characteristics of ﬁtness rank orderings responsible for genetic constraint on natural selection.},

	abstract = {Experiments show that evolutionary ﬁtness landscapes can have a rich combinatorial structure due to epistasis. For some landscapes, this structure can produce a computational constraint that prevents evolution from ﬁnding local ﬁtness optima—thus overturning the traditional assumption that local ﬁtness peaks can always be reached quickly if no other evolutionary forces challenge natural selection. Here, I introduce a distinction between easy landscapes of traditional theory where local ﬁtness peaks can be found in a moderate number of steps, and hard landscapes where ﬁnding local optima requires an infeasible amount of time. Hard examples exist even among landscapes with no reciprocal sign epistasis; on these semismooth ﬁtness landscapes, strong selection weak mutation dynamics cannot ﬁnd the unique peak in polynomial time. More generally, on hard rugged ﬁtness landscapes that include reciprocal sign epistasis, no evolutionary dynamics—even ones that do not follow adaptive paths—can ﬁnd a local ﬁtness optimum quickly. Moreover, on hard landscapes, the ﬁtness advantage of nearby mutants cannot drop off exponentially fast but has to follow a powerlaw that long-term evolution experiments have associated with unbounded growth in ﬁtness. Thus, the constraint of computational complexity enables open-ended evolution on ﬁnite landscapes. Knowing this constraint allows us to use the tools of theoretical computer science and combinatorial optimization to characterize the ﬁtness landscapes that we expect to see in nature. I present candidates for hard landscapes at scales from single genes, to microbes, to complex organisms with costly learning (Baldwin effect) or maintained cooperation (Hankshaw effect). Just how ubiquitous hard landscapes (and the corresponding ultimate constraint on evolution) are in nature becomes an open empirical question.},

Among the most robust conclusions from these studies is that epistasis between beneficial mutations often shows a pattern of diminishing returns, in which favorable mutations are less fit when combined than would be expected. Another robust inference is that the number of adaptive evolutionary paths is often limited to a relatively small fraction of the theoretical possibilities, owing largely to sign epistasis requiring evolutionary steps that would entail a decrease in fitness. Here we summarize these and other results while also examining issues that remain unresolved and future directions that seem promising.},

	abstract = {Since Bateson's discovery that genes can suppress the phenotypic effects of other genes, gene interactions—called epistasis—have been the topic of a vast research effort. Systems and developmental biologists study epistasis to understand the genotype–phenotype map, whereas evolutionary biologists recognize the fundamental importance of epistasis for evolution. Depending on its form, epistasis may lead to divergence and speciation, provide evolutionary benefits to sex and affect the robustness and evolvability of organisms. That epistasis can itself be shaped by evolution has only recently been realized. Here, we review the empirical pattern of epistasis, and some of the factors that may affect the form and extent of epistasis. Based on their divergent consequences, we distinguish between interactions with or without mean effect, and those affecting the magnitude of fitness effects or their sign. Empirical work has begun to quantify epistasis in multiple dimensions in the context of metabolic and fitness landscape models. We discuss possible proximate causes (such as protein function and metabolic networks) and ultimate factors (including mutation, recombination, and the importance of natural selection and genetic drift). We conclude that, in general, pleiotropy is an important prerequisite for epistasis, and that epistasis may evolve as an adaptive or intrinsic consequence of changes in genetic robustness and evolvability.},

	abstract = {A major challenge of contemporary biology is to understand how naturally occurring genetic variation causes phenotypic variation in quantitative traits. Despite the biological plausibility that genetic variation affects nonlinear networks at multiple levels of biological organization, most efforts to explain the relationship between genetic and phenotypic variation concentrate on additive effects of individual loci.Mapping gene–gene interactions (that is, epistasis) is challenging experimentally, statistically and computationally owing to the large number of interactions to be evaluated. This number is of the order of the square of the number of single-locus tests for pairwise interactions.Epistatic interactions for quantitative traits result in a change of either the magnitude or the direction of allelic effects at one locus, depending on the genotype at the interacting locus. With epistasis, the additive effect (that is, the main effect) of a locus changes with the allele frequency of the interacting locus, such that estimates of effects at a single interacting locus will differ between populations with different allele frequencies.Epistasis generates mostly additive variance for quantitative traits; therefore, the observation that most genetic variance for quantitative traits is additive is not inconsistent with an underlying epistatic genetic architecture. Experimental designs that are only possible in model organisms allow the exploration of the gene–gene interaction space, and the results of these analyses indicate that epistasis is pervasive.Genetic interaction networks are derived by assessing quantitative trait phenotypes of wild-type, single-mutant and double-mutant genotypes. These networks show scale-free and small-world properties, such that the major features of network topology may be inferred by focusing on major hub genes and on interactions among the genes with which they interact. Combining genomics with mutant-interaction screens may aid the identification of network hubs.Taking advantage of multifactorial perturbations in quantitative trait locus (QTL)-mapping populations is less laborious than constructing all pairwise combinations of mutant alleles, and the ability to construct chromosome substitution lines, introgression lines and near-isogenic lines in model organisms maximizes power to detect interactions. Epistasis is commonly observed, even between loci without significant main effects, but there are only a few cases in which the actual interacting variants have been identified.Natural populations harbour hidden reservoirs of cryptic genetic variation that can be revealed by introducing mutations onto wild-derived backgrounds. When this approach is implemented in a QTL-mapping population, it is a powerful experimental design for identifying naturally occurring variants that either enhance or suppress the mutant phenotype.Observations of cryptic genetic variation and less-than-additive epistatic interactions between QTLs suggest that natural populations have evolved suppressing epistatic interactions as homeostatic (that is, canalizing) mechanisms for quantitative traits. Pervasive epistasis has consequences for plant and animal breeding, evolutionary biology and human genetics.In the future, assessment of the pleiotropic effects of genetic interactions on transcriptional, metabolic and protein–protein interaction networks will provide insights into the mechanistic basis of epistasis for organismal phenotypes.},

This research reveals the importance of three major themes: multiple genetic and non-genetic mechanisms to generate phenotypic diversity, robustness in genetic systems, and adaptive landscape topography.

To date, thousands of SNPs have been associated with diseases and other complex traits. Statistical analysis typically looks for association between a phenotype and a SNP taken individually via single-locus tests. However, geneticists admit this is an oversimplified approach to tackle the complexity of underlying biological mechanisms. Interaction between SNPs, namely epistasis, must be considered. Unfortunately, epistasis detection gives rise to analytic challenges since analyzing every SNP combination is at present impractical at a genome-wide scale. In this review, we will present the main strategies recently proposed to detect epistatic interactions, along with their operating principle. Some of these methods are exhaustive, such as multifactor dimensionality reduction, likelihood ratio-based tests or receiver operating characteristic curve analysis; some are non-exhaustive, such as machine learning techniques (random forests, Bayesian networks) or combinatorial optimization approaches (ant colony optimization, computational evolution system).},

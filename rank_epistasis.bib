	abstract = {Genotypic ﬁtness landscapes are constructed by assessing the ﬁtness of all possible combinations of a given number of mutations. In the last years, several experimental ﬁtness landscapes have been completely resolved. As ﬁtness landscapes are high-dimensional, simple measures of their structure are used as statistics in empirical applications. Epistasis is one of the most relevant features of ﬁtness landscapes. Here we propose a new natural measure of the amount of epistasis based on the correlation of ﬁtness effects of mutations. This measure has a natural interpretation, captures well the interaction between mutations and can be obtained analytically for most landscape models. We discuss how this measure is related to previous measures of epistasis (number of peaks, roughness/slope, fraction of sign epistasis, Fourier–Walsh spectrum) and how it can be easily extended to landscapes with missing data or with ﬁtness ranks only. Furthermore, the dependence of the correlation of ﬁtness effects on mutational distance contains interesting information about the patterns of epistasis. This dependence can be used to uncover the amount and nature of epistatic interactions in a landscape or to discriminate between different landscape models.},

	abstract = {Populations exposed to a high mutation rate harbor abundant deleterious genetic variation, leading to depressed mean fitness. This reduction in mean fitness presents an opportunity for selection to restore fitness through the evolution of mutational robustness. In extreme cases, selection for mutational robustness can lead to flat genotypes (with low fitness but high robustness) outcompeting fit genotypes (with high fitness but low robustness)—a phenomenon known as survival of the flattest. While this effect was previously explored using the digital evolution system Avida, a complete analysis of the local fitness landscapes of fit and flat genotypes has been lacking, leading to uncertainty about the genetic basis of the survival-of-the-flattest effect. Here, we repeated the survival-of-the-flattest study and analyzed the mutational neighborhoods of fit and flat genotypes. We found that the flat genotypes, compared to the fit genotypes, had a reduced likelihood of deleterious mutations as well as an increased likelihood of neutral and, surprisingly, of lethal mutations. This trend holds for mutants one to four substitutions away from the wild-type sequence. We also found that flat genotypes have, on average, no epistasis between mutations, while fit genotypes have, on average, positive epistasis. Our results demonstrate that the genetic causes of mutational robustness on complex fitness landscapes are multifaceted. While the traditional idea of the survival of the flattest emphasized the evolution of increased neutrality, others have argued for increased mutational sensitivity in response to strong mutational loads. Our results show that both increased neutrality and increased lethality can lead to the evolution of mutational robustness. Furthermore, strong negative epistasis is not required for mutational sensitivity to lead to mutational robustness. Overall, these results suggest that mutational robustness is achieved by minimizing heritable deleterious variation.},

	abstract = {Parallel and convergent evolution have been remarkably common observations in molecular adaptation but primarily in the context of the same genotype adapting to the same conditions. These phenomena therefore tell us about the stochasticity and limitations of adaptation. The limited data on convergence and parallelism in the adaptation of different genotypes conflict as to the importance of such events. If the effects of beneficial mutations are highly context dependent (i.e., if they are epistatic), different genotypes should adapt through different mutations. Epistasis for beneficial mutations has been investigated but mainly through measurement of interactions between individually beneficial mutations for the same genotype. We examine epistasis for beneficial mutations at a broader genetic scale by measuring the fitness effects of two mutations beneficial for the {ssDNA} bacteriophage {ID}11 in eight different, related genotypes showing 0.3–3.7\% nucleotide divergence from {ID}11. We found no evidence for sign epistasis, but the mutations tended to have much smaller or no effects on fitness in the new genotypes. We found evidence for diminishing-returns epistasis; the effects were more beneficial for lower-fitness genotypes. The patterns of epistasis were not determined by phylogenetic relationships to the original genotype. To improve our understanding of the patterns of epistasis, we fit the data to a model in which each mutation had a constant, nonepistatic phenotypic effect across genotypes and the phenotype-fitness map had a single optimum. This model fit the data well, suggesting that epistasis for these mutations was due to nonlinearity in the phenotype-fitness mapping and that the likelihood of parallel evolution depends more on phenotype than on genotype.},

	abstract = {The fitness effect of mutations can be influenced by their interactions with the environment, other mutations, or both. Previously, we constructed 32 ( = 25) genotypes that comprise all possible combinations of the first five beneficial mutations to fix in a laboratory-evolved population of Escherichia coli. We found that (i) all five mutations were beneficial for the background on which they occurred; (ii) interactions between mutations drove a diminishing returns type epistasis, whereby epistasis became increasingly antagonistic as the expected fitness of a genotype increased; and (iii) the adaptive landscape revealed by the mutation combinations was smooth, having a single global fitness peak. Here we examine how the environment influences epistasis by determining the interactions between the same mutations in two alternative environments, selected from among 1,920 screened environments, that produced the largest increase or decrease in fitness of the most derived genotype. Some general features of the interactions were consistent: mutations tended to remain beneficial and the overall pattern of epistasis was of diminishing returns. Other features depended on the environment; in particular, several mutations were deleterious when added to specific genotypes, indicating the presence of antagonistic interactions that were absent in the original selection environment. Antagonism was not caused by consistent pleiotropic effects of individual mutations but rather by changing interactions between mutations. Our results demonstrate that understanding adaptation in changing environments will require consideration of the combined effect of epistasis and pleiotropy across environments.},

Novel experimental approaches combined with next-generation sequencing ({NGS}) methods enable accurate and extensive studies of the fitness effects of mutations, allowing us to test theoretical predictions and improve our understanding of the shape of the true underlying fitness landscape and its implications for the predictability and repeatability of evolution. Here, we present a uniquely large multiallelic fitness landscape comprising 640 engineered mutants that represent all possible combinations of 13 amino acid-changing mutations at 6 sites in the heat-shock protein Hsp90 in
              Saccharomyces cerevisiae
              under elevated salinity. Despite a prevalent pattern of negative epistasis in the landscape, we find that the global fitness peak is reached via four positively epistatic mutations. Combining traditional and extending recently proposed theoretical and statistical approaches, we quantify features of the global multiallelic fitness landscape. Using subsets of the data, we demonstrate that extrapolation beyond a known part of the landscape is difficult owing to both local ruggedness and amino acid-specific epistatic hotspots and that inference is additionally confounded by the nonrandom choice of mutations for experimental fitness landscapes.},

Setting these measures of epistasis to zero yields alternative definitions of non-epistasis.

	abstract = {The evolution of multiple antibiotic resistance is an increasing global problem. Resistance mutations are known to impair fitness, and the evolution of resistance to multiple drugs depends both on their costs individually and on how they interact—epistasis. Information on the level of epistasis between antibiotic resistance mutations is of key importance to understanding epistasis amongst deleterious alleles, a key theoretical question, and to improving public health measures. Here we show that in an antibiotic-free environment the cost of multiple resistance is smaller than expected, a signature of pervasive positive epistasis among alleles that confer resistance to antibiotics. Competition assays reveal that the cost of resistance to a given antibiotic is dependent on the presence of resistance alleles for other antibiotics. Surprisingly we find that a significant fraction of resistant mutations can be beneficial in certain resistant genetic backgrounds, that some double resistances entail no measurable cost, and that some allelic combinations are hotspots for rapid compensation. These results provide additional insight as to why multi-resistant bacteria are so prevalent and reveal an extra layer of complexity on epistatic patterns previously unrecognized, since it is hidden in genome-wide studies of genetic interactions using gene knockouts.},

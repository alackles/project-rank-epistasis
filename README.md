# Rank Epistasis: A rank-based model of genome connectivity

This paper (in prep) introduces **rank epistasis** as a rank-based analysis of genome connectivity. Rank epistasis is unique in that it makes no assumption about baseline fitness interactions and requires only comparative fitness levels, not absolute. 

Preliminary results were [published](https://direct.mit.edu/isal/proceedings/isal2020/160/98444) and presented at the 2020 Artificial Life Conference.
